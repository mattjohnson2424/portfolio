          An investor approached me with the funds to construct a cryptocurrency
          mining rig. Once I had the funds to start ordering the various
          components, my desk quickly filled up with boxes containing parts.

          Because of the overpriced rig frames due to the crypto mining bullrun,
          which was currently taking place, I built my own frame which saved me
          around $100.
