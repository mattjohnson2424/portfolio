          Terry College of Business), we began to work on a project combining
          our two fields, Finance and Computer Science .

          I am currently designing a new program in Python that will send

          This program will import historical stock market data from various
          companies and use indicators such as RSI, MACD, Support/Resistance,
          and Volume Indicators to determine whether the program should set off
          an alert.
